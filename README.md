# This is the code repository for the "Advanced Topics in Database Systems" Semester Project

This semester project focuses on analyzing large datasets using data science processing techniques with Apache Hadoop (version >= 3.0) and Apache Spark (version >= 3.5).

## Project Goals

* Familiarization with installing and managing distributed Apache Spark and Apache Hadoop systems.
* Apply modern techniques through Spark APIs for big data analysis.
* Understand the capabilities and limitations of these tools in relation to available resources and configurations.

## Resources

The Project was hosted on a specially configured environment in the AWS cloud.
The Code was developed and tested on Amazon's SageMaker AI Notebooks using S3 buckets for storage.
